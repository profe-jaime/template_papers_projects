Reviewer questionnaire — Proposal v2 (short guide)

Please answer briefly to each item; mark Major / Minor / Suggestion where relevant.

1) Estimand and population
- Is the estimand (ATE) clearly defined and justified for the stated population? (Major/Minor/Suggestion)
- Is the population and eligibility/exclusion criteria clear? Comment:

2) Identification and DAG
- Does the DAG include relevant measured/unmeasured confounders and mediators? (Major/Minor/Suggestion)
- Is the chosen identification strategy (back-door) plausible given the DAG? If not, suggest alternatives.

3) Estimators and implementation
- Is the choice of primary estimator (TMLE) appropriate? Are IPTW and DML suitable secondary checks? Comments:
- Are the diagnostics (balance, weights distribution) and variance estimation plans sufficient?

4) Robustness and sensitivity
- Are the proposed robustness checks (E-value, Rosenbaum bounds, placebo tests, simulations) adequate? Suggest additional tests.

5) Empirical plan and datasets
- Do the selected datasets (IHDP, LaLonde, Twins, ACIC) cover the necessary test cases? Any additional datasets recommended?

6) Reproducibility and materials
- Is the provided code/data sufficient to reproduce main results? If not, what is missing?

7) Writing and audience
- Is the manuscript clear for the target journals (Q2/Q3)? Suggest structural or emphasis changes.

8) Ethical/conflict notes
- Any potential conflicts or ethical concerns about the data or analysis approach?

Optional: Please provide 2–3 concrete suggestions or references (post-2015) that strengthen the methods or comparisons.
