Review (simulated) — Michael E. West

Major assessment

The proposal provides a useful observational workflow but should guide applied researchers on when to prefer design-based alternatives (e.g., randomized designs, DRPT) versus relying on observational pipelines. This pragmatic guidance helps target journals and practitioners assess real-world applicability.

Suggested edits

1. Add a one-page decision flowchart or short checklist that helps investigators choose between pursuing improved study design (e.g., DRPT, encouragement designs, instrumental approaches) and applying the observational workflow presented.  
2. Provide concrete examples or case studies (even synthetic) where an observational approach can be expected to provide trustworthy estimates versus cases where design upgrades are necessary.

Empirical checks to add

- Compare observational estimates to a simulated RCT baseline in the simulations section to show typical bias magnitudes and when corrections (TMLE/DML) reduce bias.  
- Suggest practical thresholds (e.g., magnitude of residual imbalance, weight variance) beyond which observational estimates should be treated cautiously.

Reference guidance

Include references on DRPT and design-based alternatives and a short paragraph advising data-collection or design changes when feasible.

Actionable checklist (high priority)

- Add a 1-page decision flowchart and brief text on design alternatives.  
- Add simulation comparing observational pipeline to an RCT benchmark and summarize findings in a short table.
