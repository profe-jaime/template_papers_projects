Review (simulated) — John P. A. Ioannidis

Major assessment

The manuscript is methodologically strong, but the presentation should more explicitly temper causal claims and foreground uncertainty due to untestable assumptions. Readers and applied audiences benefit from clear statements that results are conditional on assumptions and from quantified sensitivity analyses that bound the impact of violations.

Suggested edits

1. Add a short "Limitations and robustness" subsection that explicitly lists untestable assumptions (no unmeasured confounding, positivity, SUTVA) and indicates how conclusions would change if these fail.  
2. Provide E-values for main point estimates and a Rosenbaum-style sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounding; include a table showing the strength of unobserved confounding required to explain away the effect.

Empirical checks to add

- Tipping-point analysis: compute how large an omitted confounder would need to be to reduce the estimated effect to zero and present results under a few plausible confounder prevalences.  
- Robustness to alternative specifications: show results across several covariate adjustment sets and weighting/trimming thresholds.

Reference guidance

Point to empirical guidance on E-values and sensitivity analysis, and include a short example in the appendix so applied readers can follow.

Actionable checklist (high priority)

- Add a limitations subsection and add E-value/Rosenbaum sensitivity tables.  
- Add tipping-point analysis and a robustness table across model specifications.
